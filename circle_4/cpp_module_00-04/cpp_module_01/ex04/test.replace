This file is for test.
Let's write anything in this documents.
What about graphics pipeline?
Let's start with model space. We need to transform model to viewport space.
First, we should transform model to world space for relation with hmmm others.
Then the main camera is a main observer so hmmm the models should be transformed into camera space.
If hmmm the objects were transformed into camera space, we can do some optimization like backspace culling for view-frustum culling.
and then, we can transform viewed objects to NDC and perspective occurs in this stage
Lastly, we can project hmmm the vertices into viewport space.
Don't forget to flip y-axis if you use viewport coordinate in y dir is in negative one.
