Let's write bbbnything in this documents.
Whbbbt bbbbout grbbbphics pipeline?
Let's stbbbrt with model spbbbce. We need to trbbbnsform model to viewport spbbbce.
First, we should trbbbnsform model to world spbbbce for relbbbtion with bbbll others.
Then the mbbbin cbbbmerbbb is bbb mbbbin observer so bbbll the models should be trbbbnsformed into cbbbmerbbb spbbbce.
If bbbll the objects were trbbbnsformed into cbbbmerbbb spbbbce, we cbbbn do some optimizbbbtion like bbbbckspbbbce culling for view-frustum culling.
bbbnd then, we cbbbn trbbbnsform viewed objects to NDC bbbnd perspective occurs in this stbbbge
Lbbbstly, we cbbbn project bbbll the vertices into viewport spbbbce.
Don't forget to flip y-bbbxis if you use viewport coordinbbbte in y dir is in negbbbtive one.
